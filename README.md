# About our project 

in our small project, we started with an introduction to the game, followed by identifying the problems that the game solves. We also began to develop a plan of action and identify both functional and non-functional requirements. To facilitate understanding of the relationships between these requirements, we utilized diagrams.

Using diagrams helped us to create maps of the site, dependency maps, and process maps in order to show the relationships between the requirements and clarify the necessary steps to achieve them. Additionally, we used diagrams to design the user interface models for the game, which illustrated the flow of interaction between players, characters, and tools within the game.

Overall, our project involved identifying the requirements, both functional and non-functional, and designing solutions to solve the problems that the game aims to address. By using diagrams, we could easily visualize the relationships between the requirements and prioritize tasks, resulting in a more efficient development process.
